# Non-active Layer Transfer Matrix Method

Computes the transmission, reflection and absorption spectra of a planar microcavities compose of dielectric spacers, 
non-active organic absorbers and metal or dielectric mirrors. Observables are obtained using the transfer matrix (TMM) method.

## Description

The MATLAB code in the matlab folder works for a specific cavity. The python code in the python folder is more general,
and can be used to define new dielectric functions or more layers.

## Python code

There are 2 py files, dielectric_functions.py and TMM.py, the later has the functions to run a given cavity using the functions
defined in the former. 

There is and example in the jupyter notebook (intensity.ipynb).
